USAGE

peaks --output-path DIRECTORY [OPTIONS] INPUT_FILE_1 [INPUT_FILE_2 ...]

EXAMPLES

./peaks --output-path . ../big40/Table1.txt

The output file has the same file name as the input file but in the output directory. File ./Table1.txt now contains the clusters in ../big40/Table1.txt according to the algorithm described in the paper "Enhanced Brain Imaging Genetics in UK Biobank." The output should be identical to ../big40/Table2.txt.

./peaks --output-path . --chromosome X ../big40/Table1.txt

The output is as before except filtered to only the X chromosome. The output should be identical to ../big40/Table2X.txt.

./peaks --output-path . ../big40/Table1fmg.txt

The output is the clusters in the Fisher hits. The lead rsid of the last cluster should be rs5955807 with associated phenotype V1991. The output should be identical to ../big40/Table2fmg.txt.

./peaks --output-path . --find rs5955807 --variants-file ~/Downloads/variants.txt --chromosome X ../big40/Table1.txt

Recreate ../big40/Table2X.txt as in the second example. Use the downloaded variants file to match rs5955807 from the Fisher clusters against the output clusters. In addition to the output file as before, the standard output prints two successful matches:

rs5955807 rs146090761 rs139593778

The first field is the query itself (rs5955807), which is followed by a space-separated list of matching output clusters (rs146090761 rs139593778). If there are no matches, the list is empty. If the query is not in the variants file, the list is replaced with the error message NOT_IN_VARIANTS_FILE.

MORE OPTIONS

In addition to the options in the examples above, there are the following extra options:

--min-p 7.5
Exclude all entries with negative log-10 p-value field less than 7.5.

--min-maf 0.01
Exclude all entries with MAF less than 0.01. Requires --variants-file.

--table-1
Generate Table 1 format files (intra-phenotype clustering). Each input file should contain all the entries for one and only one phenotype. Requires --variants-file. The default operation without this flag is Table 2 format files (inter-phenotype clustering).

--max-procs 8
Use 8 worker processes to process input files. Keep this value less than or equal to the number of input files. Not only does this finish faster due to parallelism, it also saves memory over running peaks on each file since shared read-only data (such as a variants file or exclude file) loaded before the fork is not physically duplicated in memory on copy-on-write operating systems such as Linux.

--exclude-file exclude.txt
Exclude all entries in the exclude file.

--pad
Pad input chromosome field value "X" into "0X" before output.
